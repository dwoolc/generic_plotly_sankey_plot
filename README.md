# generic_plotly_sankey_plot
Functions to take columns from a dataframe and plot as a Sankey

To use the functions, a dataframe and the column names from the Sankey are required. Column names must be ordered as intended for display. It can take two or more columns, and will plot the nodes in order, so that the second of three columns will plot from the first to the second, then from the second to the third. 

There are options to use a value from the dataframe e.g. transactions or costs, or to use frequency.
